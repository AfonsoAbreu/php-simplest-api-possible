## Description
This is a simple school project, I figured it was worth it to upload it to GitHub.

## Architecture
It contains a rather pretty frontend (thanks to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)), with all the basic functionalities for managing content.

It's backend is the atually interesting part, because it envolves no in-code routing system, instead, it uses Apache's `.htaccess` files to redirect requests, it was done like that to make it's development time  shorter (come on, it's _just_ a school project), but I found this solution to be quite interesting for projects like this one.

## :warning: Warning
As this is a school project, some parts of it were commented in brazilian portuguese because that's my native language, and so it might be a bit harder to understand those comments and variable names for those who can't understand portuguese (undestanding spanish may help, as it's similar).
Good Luck :smile:
